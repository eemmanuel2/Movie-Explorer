The Movie Explorer: A simple web-app that displays a different movie (4 of my favorite movies to be exact) each time the page is refreshed along side it's wikipedia page.

This app was created in python using functionalities such as Flask, Html, Css, etc. The APIs used here were TMDB's API and Wikipedia's API.

To install this program on your own you would need to have Flask, python-dotenv, wikipedia-api, and requests all imported and installed correctly.

Some problems I had come along building this application had to due with my wikipedia function. I could not find out a way to connect this function into my main so that anytime a random movie would come up, then the same random wikipedia would also come up as well. The solution to that problem for now is that I have placed all the wikipedia links needed in the html file. I will update this when fixed. - UPDATED 2/13/2022

I fixed the wikipedia part so now the app is now working properly and is all the way functional. I combined my previous wiki.py with my tmdb.py to form one function. I was confused, I didn't know we could call 2 URLS under the same .py file but I did some research and later found out this was possible 

I'm still planning on solving all my technical issues with further research, I also plan to make this website a little bit better on the eyes! - UPDATED 2/13/2022

I solved all my technical issues and in my honest opinion I think it looks pretty on the eyes :)!
