The Movie Explorer: A simple web-app that displays a different movie (4 of my favorite movies to be exact) each time the page is refreshed along side it's wikipedia page. This app has an added feature where you will be able to sign up and register to rate the movie and give a comment of your own!

This app was created in python using functionalities such as Flask, Html, Css, SQLAlchemy, etc. The APIs used here were TMDB's API and Wikipedia's API.

To install this program on your own you would need to have Flask, python-dotenv, wikipedia-api, flask_login, flask_sqlalchemy, psycopg2 and requests all imported and installed correctly.

A problem that I am stuck on today is that whenever I refresh the page after giving my rate and comment, another rate and comment appears (a duplicate of mine) I've been working on this for many hours and I know it has something to do with my loop but I can't quite figure it out. I'll still be trying to fix and update this as I work on thru this project. 

Another technical issue that I ran into was implementing the login system. I didn't realize I had to import flask_login to finally get everything to work properly. I looked up a solution on how to load the user using LoginManager and finally had everything working properly.

I thought that implementing this project and app wouldn't be so difficult for me but as I am an amatuer in Python, Flask, and SQL this was a very difficult task. I planned to finish up in a couple days but that clearly didn't go thru right. I hope to perfect my project by the end of this semester but as of now here's the Movie Explorer!
